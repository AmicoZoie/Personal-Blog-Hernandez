Your beloved author has led yet another successful academic endeavor regarding a speech choir! We’ve performed dedicated to a timely issue within our country. Corruption. I have led a group of 12 chaotic students to an excellent mark in the subject Araling Panlipunan. After sleepless nights of script proofreading and writing, days of prop making, and hours of repetitive practices, your group hath triumphed! Despite the obstacles in our path, including miscommunication, exhaustion, and sick group mates, we have attained a perfect mark despite all circumstances! Hopefully, your author has yet to experience the last of affairs as memorable as this one

Your lady hath travelled yet again! On this day, your author is travelling for the first time overseas! I shall be on a voyage to the Land of Smiles, Thailand! And hopefully, memories of wide smiles shall be remembered through the years. This journey shall be chaperoned by the author’s mother and more close family. A week-long tour around the beautiful attractions of the country awaits! The planned itinerary includes spectacular local delicacies (including exotic street food), awe-strucking temples, beautiful natural sights, and many more! I do hope to acquire knowledge on the culture and beliefs of this country, and maybe new books to add to my collection. Exciting, isn’t it? Do wish your beloved writer some luck on promenading the busy streets and the communication barrier. 
<br>
-Yours truly, Lady Z.

Another travel during the Christmas Season is to be added in Lady Z’s Journal! I have travelled to a far point of the Philippines, The Summer Capital, Baguio! For the first time, my family and I have attempted the bus system to travel to the far city. We are currently experiencing temperatures unlike that of the climate I usually experience in Marikina. We have promenade through the well known “Session Road”, exploring different thrift shops and pop up stores. Your beloved writer additionally experienced the delicious strawberry flavoured delicacies, and travels to different attractions like “The Mansion” and different historical landmarks.

-Yours truly, Lady Z.
